 #Events
 me_nitra.1.t: "The Slavic Bridge"
 me_nitra.1.d: "Before the Hungarian invasion of the Carpathian basin, the Pannonian March of the Frankish Empire had been inhabited by mostly Slavic population. The area was even ruled by Pribina, a Prince of Nitra who was banished by Mojmír following the formation of Great Moravia, and its capital of Blatnograd was a regional cultural centre of the Slavs. Now that this area has returned to its rightful owners, we must decide the fate of the region. Shall we restore the bridge between the West and South Slavs?"
 me_nitra.1.a: "The Hungarians must be expelled!"
 me_nitra.1.b: "They shall be assimilated over time"
 me_nitra.1.c: "We shall protect their rights and preserve their culture"
 me_nitra.3.t: "Restoration of Great Moravia"
 me_nitra.3.d: "Great Moravia was a powerful union of the Slavic nations which existed in the late 9th century. From their seat in Veligrad, the great rulers of Moravia governed and expanded their vast realm, transforming it from a Frankish vassal into an independent regional power in less than 30 years. Unfortunately, after the death of Svatopluk I, the country disintegrated due to internal struggle, succession war and the invasion of the Magyar tribes. Our people greatly suffered ever since, but now, after many centuries, we have finally reclaimed what once belonged to our ancestors. The Great Moravia is reborn!"
 me_nitra.3.a: "Glory to us!"
 me_nitra.4.t: "Matica Slovenská"
 me_nitra.4.d: "Our dream of an institution which would protect our culture has come to fruition. Founded in the town of Turcianský Svätý Martin, Matica will play a central role in the future development of our culture; be it the development of our regions, work in particular on young people in the spirit of national and moral values, increase of the national awareness, strengthening of relations of the cultures of citizens who declare themselves to national minorities and ethnic groups in the territory of our realm, or the promotion of Slovak patriotism. However, there is still conflict amongst our elites as to what should be the primary focus of this institution."
 me_nitra.4.a: "Development of our regions"
 me_nitra.4.b: "Preservation of our culture"
 me_nitra.4.c: "Good relations with ethnic minorities"
 me_nitra.4.de: "Spiritual, moral, and ethnic values"
 me_nitra.4.e: "Spreading of the Slovak culture"
 me_nitra.5.t: "Westernization"
 me_nitra.5.d: "Over a century ago, we have aligned ourselves with the Holy Roman Empire. Since we suddenly found ourselves under an ever increasing influence of German and Italian culture, this action would slowly reshape our culture to a more western-like style. For centuries, we have been linked to the Eastern Europe, but now, many are advocating for our further Westernization and stronger bond with the Holy Roman Empire. What shall we do?"
 me_nitra.5.a: "Our future lies in the West!"
 me_nitra.5.b: "The West threatens our values and identity!"
 me_nitra.6.t: "Restoration of Veligrad"
 me_nitra.6.d: "Centuries ago, the mighty city of Veligrad served as the capital of the Great Moravian Empire. The legend has it that the city was razed to the ground and put to torch by the invading Magyar tribes following the collapse of the central authority in Moravia. Now as the region where the city once stood is once again controlled by us, some suggest that perhaps, we should rebuild Veligrad to further strengthen our legitimacy and claim to the legacy of Great Moravia."
 me_nitra.6.a: "Veligrad shall become our new capital!"
 me_nitra.6.b: "The seat of power will stay in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 me_nitra.9.t: "The Birth of Pan-Slavism"
 me_nitra.9.d: "Ever since their inception, the Slavic nations have been disunited and quarreled with each other for the most terribly insignificant purposes. This has led to the rest of the civilized world treating us with nothing but contempt, seeing us as nothing more than barbarians beyond their borders. Well, no more! No more shall the great Slavic peoples be bent to do the will of our neighbors! We now hold it as our solemn duty to lead the Slavs on a path to become on-par, if not eclipse the powers of the west. This entails a need for unification, for if we lay divided and vulnerable, we will soon fall."
 me_nitra.9.a: "Sláva Rodu!"
 
 #Missions
 slo_independence_war_title: "Freedom Figthers"
 slo_independence_war_desc: "The crushing defeat of the Christian coalition at the Battle of Varna saw to Christendom's failure in the Crusade. The untimely demise of our king has sent shockwave tearing through much of Europe, as the Catholics now reel in horror. The Hungarian kingdom is in shambles as the future of the Holy Crown is uncertain, and this power vacuum gives us a one-time chance to restore the autonomous status of Nitra which was abolished by the King Coloman in 1110, or perhaps even secede from Hungary and reclaim independence."
 slo_break_chains_title: "Breaking the Chains"
 slo_break_chains_desc: "After centuries, the chains of Hungarian control have finally been broken. The Crusade of Varna has brought them ruin and damnation, and to us it has brought gifts most wonderful."
 slo_imperial_protection_title: "Seek Imperial Protection"
 slo_imperial_protection_desc: "Even though our intention to restore hegemony over Central Europe is clear, the path to achieve that will be long at difficult. While still weak, we must turn to other countries for protection, and one such option is the Holy Roman Empire."
 slo_transdanubia_title: "Recover Transdanubia"
 slo_transdanubia_desc: "There has never been a better time to expand our national borders than now! The Hungarians are weak and tired due to their foolishness. Transdanubia - a land once inhabited by the Slavs shall return to its rightful owner."
 slo_galicia_title: "Rex Galiciae et Lodomeriae"
 slo_galicia_desc: "King Louis I led a campaign against the Lithuanian prince George who ruled the lands of Galicia. His mighty army was able to quickly defeat the foe, forcing local princes to accept his suzerainty. As the only real successor state to disintegrated Hungary, it would be wise to use their claims to expand our realm."
 slo_recover_vistula_title: "Claim Vislania"
 slo_recover_vistula_desc: "Centuries ago, Svatopluk I gathered his army and marched beyond the Tatras to the land of the Vistulans - a powerful Pagan tribe which threatened the northern borders of Moravia. His victory was followed by the subjugation of the locals, and Vislania therefore became a part of Great Moravia. As the defeat in Varna caused great turmoil in Poland, we should use this time of troubles for our benefit and reclaim our historical clay."
 slo_moravia_title: "Union with Moravia"
 slo_moravia_desc: "The Great Moravian Empire was forged as a union between the principalities of Nitra and Moravia. We must liberate our brethren from the treacherous Bohemians and make them our equals in the new Moravian Empire!"
 slo_silesia_title: "Conquer Silesia"
 slo_silesia_desc: "Humiliating defeat of Bohemian armies in Moravia might result in Silesian rebellion against the weakening Czech rule. It would be unwise to let the local Counties declare independence and fall under the control of our enemies."
 slo_carpathia_title: "Carpathian Hegemony"
 slo_carpathia_desc: "For five centuries, the Carpathian basin was dominated by the Hungarians. For five centuries, we were reduced to nothing but servants. But the struggle between our nations has finally come to an end. The Hungary is no more - we are the sole power of the region!"
 slo_lion_title: "Eagle on the Lion's Throne"
 slo_lion_desc: "Czechs were amongst the first who seceded from Great Moravia following the death of Svatopluk. Their pathetic kingdom has been built on stolen glory of our ancestors, but we shall soon deliver them from their misery. The Eagle has descended from the frozen peaks of Tatras, suffocating the Czech lion in its mighty claws. The union has been restored, and it shall prevail forevermore."
 slo_great_moravia_title: "Restore Great Moravia"
 slo_great_moravia_desc: "During its golden age, the Great Moravian Empire stretched from the lands of the Lusatian Sorbs to the shores of Drava. Our claim to the lands of Moravia are most righteous, and so we shall restore the legacy of our ancestors and revive Great Moravia in its former glory!"
 slo_lusatia_title: "Subjugate Lusatia"
 slo_lusatia_desc: "Historically, Lusatian land belonged to both the Empire of Samo and Great Moravia. It is our duty to save our Slavic brethren from the grim faith which would befall them had they stayed under German suzerainty."
 slo_austria_title: "Humiliate the Habsburgs"
 slo_austria_desc: "An axe shall be swung against the throat of the Habsburgs. The eagle that was the Archduchy of Austria shall soon face its most humiliating defeat, and the entire Empire shall bleed with them."
 slo_romania_title: "Romanian Intervention"
 slo_romania_desc: "The failure at Varna has left both Romanian principalities vulnerable and weak. Without any protection, they will soon fall into the hands of the Ottomans. It is time we unite with our fellow Christian brothers and put up a defense against the tide of Anatolian infidels occupying European lands."
 slo_avenge_varna_title: "Avenge Varna"
 slo_avenge_varna_desc: "The failure at Varna shall soon be avenged. Marauders have been encroaching into the Balkans for too long. The cross shall triumph over the crescent and the Ottomans shall be reduced to ash."
 slo_bulwark_title: "Bulwark of Christianity"
 slo_bulwark_desc: "As the principal defenders of Christendom against the Ottoman threat, we have come to be known as the Bulwark of Christianity. By demonstrating our ability to match anything the infidel can throw at us, we can ensure that this title is thoroughly deserved!"
 slo_adriatic_title: "Access the Adriatic"
 slo_adriatic_desc: "Hardly anyone can match the might of our armies on land, but at sea, we are still very weak. The Kingdom of Croatia has broken away from the Hungarian union, and we could make a good use of their navy and maritime tradition."
 slo_devin_title: "Repair Devín"
 slo_devin_desc: "Overlooking the border with East Francia, Devin used to be one of the mightiest fortifications of the Great Moravian Empire. Over centuries, it has been reduced to but a shade of its former glory; the glory which shall soon be restored!"
 slo_land_castles_title: "Land of Castles"
 slo_land_castles_desc: "From Moravian fortresses to mighty castles built as a defence against the invading Mongol armies, we must stay true to this legacy and never leave a border unguarded, a trade route unprotected or a castle understaffed!"
 slo_carpathian_fortress_title: "Carpathian Wall"
 slo_carpathian_fortress_desc: "The Carpathian mountains give us an extraordinary terrain advantage, a protection that many countries wish they had. However, there are numerous mountain passes through with the enemy could easily invade our heartland. Ensure that the borders are well protected!"
 slo_codify_title: "Codify Slovak Language"
 slo_codify_desc: "Following the fall of Great Moravia and separation from our western brethren, our language developed into countless regional dialects. Since Latin was the official language of the kingdom, these dialects were largely uncultivated and lacked any cohesion. If we truly wish to revive our national consciousness and identity, codifying a standardized version of the Slovak language should be our utmost priority."
 slo_slovakization_title: "Embrace Slovakization"
 slo_slovakization_desc: "For centuries, our lands were placed under foreign administration where Hungarian and Latin languages were mostly used. As an independent country, we must strive to reform our administration and fill important positions with Slovak people, removing influences of our former overlords."
 slo_matica_title: "Matica Slovenská"
 slo_matica_desc: "Eager to spread the light of knowledge, some of our brightest minds have started working on the creation of a central institution which would further develop and promote our culture, having an replaceable role in the process of national self-determination and protection of national rights, preservation of identity and development of the culture of the Slovak nation."
 slo_lightning_title: "Lightning Over the Tatras"
 slo_lightning_desc: "In order to further bond our people together, we shall follow the example of other European countries and adopt a national anthem; and there is no better patriotic song than the Lightning over the Tatras, composed by Janko Matúška.\n\nFar above the Tatra \n lightning bolts are pounding. \n These bolts we shall banish, \n brothers, they will vanish; \n Slovaks are rebounding. \n \n Our Slovakia was, \n until now, quiescent. \n But the lightning flashing \n and the thunder crashing \n made it effervescent!"
 slo_kremnica_title: "Golden Kremnica"
 slo_kremnica_desc: "Kremnica Mint was established in 1328 when Kremnica was promoted to a free royal town by the Hungarian King Charles Robert of Anjou; the mint issued several kinds of coins early on, of which the most successful was its ducat. Kremnica ducats were well known because of their good quality and were considered the hardest currency in Central Europe. Available historical records report that 21.5 million ducats were minted at the Kremnica Mint throughout its history. Let us invest into this prestigious mint in order to help the manufactoring of coins and gold."
 slo_royal_towns_title: "Confirm the Town Privileges"
 slo_royal_towns_desc: "Before the collapse of Hungary, many of our towns had been given the status of Free Royal Towns, which greatly expanded their privileges and atrracted many foreing investors. In order to preserve their prestigious status and wealth, we shall confirm their old rights."
 slo_pearl_title: "Pearl on the Danube"
 slo_pearl_desc: "Even though Prešporok is the wealthiest city of Nitra, it is still dwarfed by much grandeur capitals of the western powers. It would be a fine day were Prešporok to outstrip the other capitals and come to be considered as the principal city of the region; a true Pearl on the Danube!"
 slo_queen_title: "Queen of the Cities"
 slo_queen_desc: "Just as our country rapidly grows, so do our aspirations of grandeur. Prešporok has become the center of trade and culture in the entirety of Central Europe, but it is time we go further and turn the Pearl on the Danube to the Queen of the Cities."
 slo_industry_title: "Industrial Revolution"
 slo_industry_desc: "Our mining-based and agrarian economy is lacking behind other great powers in terms of industrialization. It is worth the investment to raise our profile in the area, and as such, to promote greater industry."
 slo_zakon_title: "Trestný Zákon"
 slo_zakon_desc: "Our legal system is still based on the outdated Zakon Sudnyi Liudem, which was written centuries ago during the times of Great Moravia. On the path of modernization, the legal reform of this text should be highly prioritized."
 slo_mestania_title: "Empower the Burghers"
 slo_mestania_desc: "The burghers represent a large portion of our population. Under the rule, the Royal Towns have attained unprecedented wealth, and so it would not be unwise to further empower the estate in order to bring prosperity and wealth to our realm."
 slo_romanticism_title: "Slovak Romanticism"
 slo_romanticism_desc: "Historically, the Slovak National Revival was driven by the Romantic generation of writes, who were usually strongly associated with the church. Generations of both Catholic and Protestant poets, politicians and activists were using the newly codified language to reinforce the national identity, increase literacy and teach the population about their nation's history. Their works have since become the core element of the Slovak national heritage."
 slo_panslavism_title: "Adopt Pan-Slavism"
 slo_panslavism_desc: "To some Slavic nations, the concept of Pan-Slavism was nothing but a byname of the Russian imperialism. However, to the Slovaks, the Pan-Slavism was one of the main driving forces of the national revival. It is time we fully embrace its ideals and ensure that our Slavic brothers are viewed as our equals in all matters. Slava rodu!"
