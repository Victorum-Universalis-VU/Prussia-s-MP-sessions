 # Events:
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME1: "The Capital of Timur"
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC1: "We have reached the capital of Tamerlane's Empire, or what it used to be. As of now it's nothing but a disembodied corpse that can show little resistance against us. We hold in our hands one of the most beautiful Muslim sites outside Arabia... and we could upon it."
 VU_Mongolia_Events1.EVTOPT1: "Here we will start our Muslim empire."
 VU_Mongolia_Events1.EVTOPT2: "Preposterous!"

 VU_Mongolia_Events2.EVTOPT1: ""
 
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME3: "The Fate of our Past"
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC3: "The Yuan dynasty has now risen anew, like a phoenix out of its ashes. But the past is something that we do not have power over, no matter how much we gallop through the prairies of time. We cannot change history, but we can change the way the future remembers it. We must choose a mindset from which to view the centuries to come."
 VU_Mongolia_Events3.EVTOPT1: "Do not deny it."
 VU_Mongolia_Events3.EVTOPT2: "We write history now."
 VU_Mongolia_Events3.EVTOPT3: "Let the people witness history as they see fit."
 
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME4: "Qufu, the Holy Site of Confucianism"
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC4: "In our conquest, we have thoughtlessly ravaged upon Qufu, the holy site and epicenter of Confucius's teachings. This school of thought believes that there is no heaven at all, yet its our duty as subjects of the Sky God to embrace all people and culture. A decision must be reached soon."
 VU_Mongolia_Events4.EVTOPT1: "This man's beliefs and ours are the same."
 VU_Mongolia_Events4.EVTOPT2: "They believe in no heaven, and no heaven shall be reserved for them."
 
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME5: "The Ruins of Fuzimiao"
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC5: "Fuzimiao used once to be the site of imperial examination, a place where only excellency and a fine mind could thrive. It was burnt down recently and with that, a great place has been lost to us completely. We could benefit from rebuilding this place... or plundering it as we keep advancing."
 VU_Mongolia_Events5.EVTOPT1: "Let us rebuild this place to its former glory!"
 VU_Mongolia_Events5.EVTOPT2: "Our money is better spent elsewhere."
 
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME6: "Fuzimiao Rebuilt"
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC6: "The Imperial Examination Center of Fuzimiao has been rebuilt. Their halls shall be decorated with the glory for millennia, and their tests shall be done under a [Root.GetAdjective] roof."
 VU_Mongolia_Events6.EVTOPT1: "We reap what we do not ravage."

 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME7: "The Question of Confucianism"
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC7: "Our conquest has brought us many subjects who embrace all religions and beliefs as if they were one. Meanwhile while we accept everything under the blue sky, they make it part of themselves. In our ever going conquest, it would benefit us to harmonize this idea and the entire earth. All for the Tengri."
 VU_Mongolia_Events7.EVTOPT1: "Perhaps, sticking to our roots is for the best."
 VU_Mongolia_Events7.EVTOPT2: "Let's adopt their beliefs - and the whole world's."
 
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME8: "Encountering Buddhism once again"
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC8: "Our brothers held high the teachings of Buddha in their hearts, just as much as they upheld the laws of the Tengri. As we press to the south-west we are now surrounded by the former. Many have no qualms on going back, and in fact, it seems that this amounts to a great part of our population. While imprudent, the laws of Tengri do accept all religions under the sky."
 VU_Mongolia_Events8.EVTOPT1: "We should go back to our dynastic roots."
 VU_Mongolia_Events8.EVTOPT2: "We should know better than to abandon our faith so rashly."
 
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME9: "Establishing a Dalai Lama"
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC9: "We have been approached by a secret stranger who seems to have reached a higher plane of existence. His mind is not only naturally sharp, but his presence instills a fear different from the one we emit - one not only of fear and power but of respect and holiness. His proposal would've gotten him executed for foolishness, if not for this very aura: to unify Buddhism in one land."
 VU_Mongolia_Events9.EVTOPT1: "We shall unify this holy land."
 VU_Mongolia_Events9.EVTOPT2: "Why not name ourselves Dalai Lama?"
 
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME10: "Tibet United"
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC10: "After many years, we have upheld our promise to Gyatso, [TIB.GetName] is united once again. But beyond these mountains lay lands unclaimed and away from our flag, our mission here is done and they are grateful, and they will follow us to the very ends of earth."
 VU_Mongolia_Events10.EVTOPT1: "Tibet shall help us envelop the world under the Dalai Lama."
 VU_Mongolia_Events10.EVTOPT2: "We shall fly the same banner."
 
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME11: "Cultural Renaissance"
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC11: "An unprecedented amount of knowledge has been pouring into our realm, originating from colossal amounts of knowledge from ancient Buddhist scriptures. We are on the very edge of a Renaissance, and we can decide how where it will be headed."
 VU_Mongolia_Events11.EVTOPT1: "Let's unite our people through our faith."
 VU_Mongolia_Events11.EVTOPT2: "Let's unite our knowledge through a common language."
 VU_Mongolia_Events11.EVTOPT3: "Let's spread our faith through the whole empire."
 
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME12: "Tamerlane's Legacy"
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC12: "As we head West we come across more people who whisper of the tale Tamerlane. A man who was neither a descendant of our great Khan and still claimed his name; and paradoxically, was not a descendant of Muhammad and still claimed to be a Caliph. No single man is sure what to consider him, and as the ones who are reuniting his lands, we must give a clear answer."
 VU_Mongolia_Events12.EVTOPT1: "Timur was a true Khan."
 VU_Mongolia_Events12.EVTOPT2: "Timur was a caliphate."
 
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME13: "Our Muslim Subjects"
 VU_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC13: "In the time of the four Khans, three of them embraced Islam as their faith. Even us, when we held the name of Yuan, brought in Muslim advisers and philosophers to help administrate our empire. As the number of believers increase, maybe we could use opening our minds a little."
 VU_Mongolia_Events13.EVTOPT1: "Accept Islam as a minority religion again."
 VU_Mongolia_Events13.EVTOPT2: "Religion is a secondary matter."
